(1) In Argus_Theorem5.5.pdf, we revise the the theoretical analysis regarding the convergence rate. 
(1.a) We remove part of the assumptions.
(1.b) We prove that the bias term is mainly affected by the gradient estimator and does not increase with the number of network agents.

(b) We draw a plot of our convergence metric.
